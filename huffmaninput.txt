The flower on her head is the wild spring chrysanthemum(miyakowasure), which in the flower language means 'the sadness of parting,' 'a short moratorium,' & 'until the day we meet again'.
This kind of chrysanthemum is rather unique, as the other subgenus of it tend to hold more positive meanings, such as 'love' and 'happiness'.
The chrysanthemum is well-celebrated in Japan, while also being the symbol of the Emperor and the Emperor's family.
