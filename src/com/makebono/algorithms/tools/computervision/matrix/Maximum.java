 * @ClassName: Maximum 
 * @Description: Maximum value in a matrix, call it peak. After convolution of rational histogram, (a) peak(s) is acutually
 * the position shows high(est) potential to have the target. And sometimes several peaks will be found, and they are actually
 * all on the target, in such situation, just average coordinates of peaks. Or it could also be simply done by return the 
 * first/last peak found.
