# Algorithms
Test field for algorithms. Everything algorithmically I suddenly come up with will be implemented and put in here, for fun.
Currently it includes:

    -Backtracking
        .EightQueens
        
    -Computational Geometry:
        .Convex hull wrapping
        .Line intersection detection
        .Closest pair picking
        
    -Dynamic programming:
        .Dynamic coin changer
        .Fibonacci number calculator
        .Tower of Hanoi solver
    
    -Graph algorithm:
        .K-Coloring
            ..Welsh-Powell's algorithm
            ..Back-tracking based k-coloring
    
    -Greedy algorithm:
        .Greedy coin changer
        .Huffman encoding and decoding
    
    -Computer vision:
        .Swain&Ballard's Color-Indexing based tracking(For now the accuracy is somewhat acceptable, 
            have plan to optimize it later)
    
    -Hungarian algorithm
        .Work distributor
    
    -Flow network
        .Ford-Fulkerson method for maximum flow
        
    -Pattern matching
        .Brute force matching
        .Knuth Morris Pratt algorithm
    
    -Pathfinder
        .A* algorithm based path finder
    
    -Sort and search:
        .Search
            ..Binary search
            ..Linear search
        .Sort
            ..Bubble sort
            ..Intersection sort
            ..Merge sort
            ..Quick sort
            ..Selection sort.
           
And some help classes like comparator, BigDecimal sqrt, etc. 
Input files for some programs are put in inputSet folder.
