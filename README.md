# Algorithms
Test field for algorithms. Everything algorithmically I suddenly come up with will be implemented and put in here, for fun.
Currently it includes:

    -Computational Geometry:
        .Convex hull wrapping
        .Line intersection detection
        
    -Dynamic programming:
        .Dynamic coin changer
        .Fibonacci number calculator
        .Tower of Hanoi solver
    
    -Greedy algorithm:
        .Greedy coin changer
        .Huffman encoding and decoding
    
    -Hungarian algorithm
        .Work distributor
        
    -Pathfinder
        .A* algorithm based path finder
    
    -Sort and search:
        .Search
            ..Binary search
            ..Linear search
        .Sort
            ..Bubble sort
            ..Intersection sort
            ..Merge sort
            ..Quick sort
            ..Selection sort.
           
And some help classes like comparator, BigDecimal sqrt, etc. And 2 input text for A* and Huffman coding.
Instruction put in each algorithm class. But later I will write them in the test class.
